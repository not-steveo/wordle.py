### Wordle helper because I suck at Wordle.

Uses the [PyEnchant](https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html) library.

For best results, guess 1-2 times to get at least 2 known letters and
eliminate some possible letters. You will then be asked to enter all
known letters, and then asked which letters you can eliminate from the
possible alphabet. Finally, a list of possible words will be generated
based on the information provided.
